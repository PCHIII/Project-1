The Libre-Motioâ„¢ app allows you to search for Movies or Books, by Title or Character to find if it has a corresponding Adaptation.

When a Movie is based off of a Book it is called a Literary Adaptation. Inversely, a book can be based off of a Movie or Movie Screen-play, which is called an Adaptation of Film.

With this simple tool, you can expand your awareness and access to content on the Books and Movies that interest you most.
